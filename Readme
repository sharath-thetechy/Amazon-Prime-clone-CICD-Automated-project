ðŸš€ End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline for Amazon Prime Clone on AWS
Project Summary
Built and deployed a scalable web application (Amazon Prime Clone) using a comprehensive DevOps toolchain. This project demonstrates proficiency in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), CI/CD automation, container orchestration, security scanning, and monitoring.

ðŸ§± Infrastructure Provisioning
- Utilized Terraform to provision AWS resources including EC2 instances, VPC, IAM roles, and EKS clusters.
- Configured AWS CLI and IAM credentials for secure access and automation.
- Created SSH key pairs for EC2 access and integrated with Jenkins agents.

ðŸ”„ CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
- Set up Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery.
- Configured Global Tool Configuration for JDK 17, NodeJS, Docker, and SonarQube Scanner.
- Installed essential Jenkins plugins:
- SonarQube Scanner
- NodeJS
- Docker Pipeline
- Prometheus Metrics

ðŸ“¦ Build & Quality Assurance
- Git Checkout: Pulled source code from GitHub repository.
- SonarQube Analysis: Performed static code analysis and enforced quality gates.
- NPM Install: Installed NodeJS dependencies for application build.
- Trivy Scan: Conducted security vulnerability scanning using Aqua Trivy.
- Docker Build: Containerized the application and tagged images.
- Push to AWS ECR: Uploaded Docker images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
- Image Cleanup: Removed unused images to optimize Jenkins server storage.

ðŸš€ Continuous Deployment with ArgoCD
- Created Kubernetes manifests for application deployment.
- Used ArgoCD for GitOps-based deployment to AWS EKS.
- Ensured declarative and version-controlled deployment workflows.

ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Observability
- Installed Prometheus and Grafana using Helm charts.
- Configured dashboards for real-time metrics, alerts, and cluster health monitoring.
